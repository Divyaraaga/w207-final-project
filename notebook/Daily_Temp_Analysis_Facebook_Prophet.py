# # Time Series to observe DAILY temperature variations 
# ## Daily temperature prediction using Facebook Prophet
# 
# For this analysis, to complement our analysis of models we turned to using an open-sourced library by Facebook called Prophet. https://facebook.github.io/prophet/
#     
# Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
# 
# Prophet is open source software released by Facebookâ€™s Core Data Science team. 
#     
# We have take the original series as provided and using their documentation repeated our forecasting analysis.
